## Scamaz0n Sandbox

Nothing to see here. This is just a fun internal hackathon project for Fingerprint:

- fake `scamaz0n.com` login
- already wired up to Fingerprint behind the scenes
- zero-setup sandbox so users can play with device intelligence and the Rules Engine

If you somehow found this repo and you are not in the hackathon:

- go to `https://fingerprint.com`
- create an account
- let our actual product docs guide you from there 🚀
- you&apos;ll probably still be less confused than I am building this thing

For local tinkering:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` and enjoy the chaos.
